# 🔧 METRICS FIX - Root Cause & Solution

## 🐛 The Bug

**Location:** `backend/agents/feature_agent.py` - `analyze()` method

**Problem:**
The Feature Agent was ALWAYS extracting features from the code_files parameter, even when pre-calculated features were provided via the `features` parameter in snippet-only mode.

### Flow That Was Broken:

```
Orchestrator builds features with metrics:
   features['features']['total_loc']: 151 ✅

Orchestrator calls feature_agent.analyze({}, features=features)
   ❌ Feature agent IGNORES the features parameter!

Feature agent extracts from empty code_files:
   extracted_features = self._extract_features({})
   Result: total_loc = 0, function_count = 0 ❌

Feature agent returns metrics with all zeros:
   feature_output.metadata['features']['total_loc']: 0 ❌

Orchestrator uses feature_output.metadata:
   features = feature_output.metadata
   Result: features['features']['total_loc']: 0 ❌

Routing policy receives zeros:
   raw['total_loc']: 0 ❌

Code Quality Agent receives zeros:
   total_loc: 0 ❌ (Should be 151)
```

## ✅ The Fix

**File:** `backend/agents/feature_agent.py`

**Change:** Modified the `analyze()` method to:

1. **Check if features are provided** (snippet-only mode)
2. **If yes:** Use the pre-calculated features from metadata
3. **If no:** Extract features from code files (full mode)

### Code Change:

```python
def analyze(self, code_files: Dict[str, str], features: Dict[str, Any] = None) -> AgentOutput:
    try:
        # NEW: If features are provided (snippet-only mode), use those instead of extracting
        if features and features.get("features"):
            extracted_features = features.get("features", {})
            self.logger.info("✅ Using pre-calculated features from metadata (snippet-only mode)")
        else:
            # Extract features from code files (full mode)
            extracted_features = self._extract_features(code_files)
        
        # ... rest of the method uses extracted_features
```

## 🎯 Summary

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Git-S3 saves metrics | 151 LoC ✅ | 151 LoC ✅ |
| Feature Agent processes | 0 LoC ❌ | 151 LoC ✅ |
| Routing Policy receives | 0 LoC ❌ | 151 LoC ✅ |
| Code Quality Agent shows | 0 LoC ❌ | 151 LoC ✅ |
| Frontend displays | 0 LoC ❌ | 151 LoC ✅ |

## 🚀 What to Test

Run the test again:
```bash
python test_full_flow_debug.py
```

Look for in the logs:
```
[Agent] FeatureAgent - INFO - ✅ Using pre-calculated features from metadata (snippet-only mode)
[Agent] FeatureAgent - INFO -    📊 Loaded metrics - LoC: 151, Functions: 13

[RoutingPolicy] RoutingPolicy - INFO -    raw['total_loc']: 151
[RoutingPolicy] RoutingPolicy - INFO -    complexity['function_count']: 13

[Report] Total LoC: 151 ✅
```

If you see these, the fix is working! ✅
